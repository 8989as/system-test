## Mock Data Structure

### Users
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  role_id: number,
  status: number, // 0=rejected, 1=active, 2=pending
  reason: string
}
```

### Products/Items
```javascript
{
  ID: number,
  ItemLookupCode: string,
  Description: string,
  Price: string,
  cost: [{ description, SupplierName, Cost }],
  description: [{ Description, price, PriceC, PriceA }]
}
```

### Departments/Categories/Suppliers
```javascript
{
  ID: number,
  DepartmentName/CategoryName/SupplierName: string
}
```

## Key Features Maintained

1. **Loading States**: All components maintain loading spinners with simulated delays
2. **Error Handling**: Error handling structure preserved for future API integration
3. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation remains intact
4. **User Experience**: Success/error messages updated to indicate "Static Mode"
5. **Navigation**: All routing and navigation functionality preserved
6. **Session Management**: User session storage functionality maintained

## Benefits of This Conversion

1. **Development**: Developers can work on UI/UX without backend dependencies
2. **Testing**: Components can be tested independently
3. **Demos**: App can be demonstrated without server setup
4. **Prototyping**: Rapid prototyping and design iteration possible

## Future API Integration

To restore API functionality:
1. Uncomment all API calls marked with "// API call commented out for static app"
2. Remove mock data declarations
3. Remove simulated delays (`await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay))`)
4. Update success messages to remove "(Static Mode)" indicators
