# Content Routes Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The routes `/mainpage/content/arabic/CQ001`, `/mainpage/content/english/CQ001`, and `/mainpage/content/Aqueue/AQ001` were not loading product details pages due to unrefactored API calls in the components handling these routes.

## Root Cause
Two key components had multiple unrefactored API calls:

### 1. ContentContainer.jsx
**Route Pattern:** `/mainpage/content/:Param/:Id`
**Handles:** Arabic, English, and other content routes

**API Calls Refactored:**
- ✅ `${API_URL}/content/${Id}` - GET request for existing content
- ✅ `${API_URL}/all-content/${Id}` - GET request for all content data
- ✅ `${API_URL}/option-type` - GET request for option types
- ✅ `${API_URL}/option-value` - GET request for option values
- ✅ `${API_URL}/photos/${Id}` - GET request for product images
- ✅ `${API_URL}/show-product/${Id}` - GET request for product data
- ✅ `${API_URL}/update-content` - POST request for updating existing content
- ✅ `${API_URL}/update-queue` - POST request for queue updates (multiple instances)
- ✅ `${API_URL}/log` - POST request for logging actions (multiple instances)
- ✅ `${API_URL}/insert-update` - POST request for inserting/updating content

### 2. AssortmentUpdate.jsx
**Route Pattern:** `/mainpage/content/Aqueue/:Id`
**Handles:** Assortment queue product updates

**API Calls Refactored:**
- ✅ `${API_URL}/departments` - GET request for departments
- ✅ `${API_URL}/supplier` - GET request for suppliers
- ✅ `${API_URL}/show-product/${Id}` - GET request for product data
- ✅ `${API_URL}/category` - GET request for categories
- ✅ `${API_URL}/edit-planning` - POST request for editing planning data
- ✅ `${API_URL}/log` - POST request for logging actions

## Mock Data Added

### ContentContainer Mock Data
```javascript
// Content data with multilingual support
const mockContentData = {
  Content: [{
    ItemLookupCode: Id,
    EnName: `Sample English Name ${Id}`,
    ArName: `اسم عربي عينة ${Id}`,
    EnDesc: `Sample English Description for ${Id}`,
    ArDesc: `وصف عربي عينة لـ ${Id}`,
    EnIngredients: "Sample English Ingredients",
    ArIngredients: "مكونات عربية عينة",
    Allergen: "Nuts,Dairy",
    Dietry: "Vegetarian,Gluten-Free"
  }],
  productData: [{ ItemLookupCode: Id, Description: `Sample Product ${Id}` }],
  Allergen: [{ name: "Nuts" }, { name: "Dairy" }],
  dietary: [{ name: "Vegetarian" }, { name: "Vegan" }],
  Categories: mockSelectedCats,
  Customizable_option: []
}

// Option types and values
const mockTypesRes = { type: [{ name: "Size" }, { name: "Color" }] }
const mockValuesRes = { value: [{ value: "Small" }, { value: "Large" }] }

// Product images
const mockImagesResponse = { photos: [{ file: "sample1.jpg" }] }
```

### AssortmentUpdate Mock Data
```javascript
// Departments, suppliers, categories
const mockDepartments = [{ ID: 1, DepartmentName: "Grocery" }]
const mockSuppliers = [{ ID: 1, SupplierName: "ABC Suppliers Ltd." }]
const mockCategories = [{ ID: 1, CategoryName: "Beverages" }]

// Product data with pricing
const mockProductData = [{
  lookupcode: Id,
  description: `Sample Product ${Id}`,
  Cost: "25.50",
  salestax: "14.00", 
  RetailPrice: "35.99"
}]
```
