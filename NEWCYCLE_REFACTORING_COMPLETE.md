2. ✅ **Error Handling**: Error handling structure preserved for future API integration
3. ✅ **Form Validation**: Client-side validation remains intact
4. ✅ **User Experience**: Success/error messages updated to indicate "Static Mode"
5. ✅ **Navigation**: All routing and navigation functionality preserved
6. ✅ **Role-based Logic**: User role-based navigation and permissions maintained

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All NewCycle components have been successfully converted to static mode with hardcoded data. The application now functions completely independently without requiring any backend services while maintaining all original functionality and user experience.

## Next Steps

To restore API functionality in the future:
1. Uncomment all API calls marked with "// API call commented out for static app"
2. Remove mock data declarations
3. Remove simulated delays (`await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay))`)
4. Update success messages to remove "(Static Mode)" indicators
5. Test API integration with backend services
